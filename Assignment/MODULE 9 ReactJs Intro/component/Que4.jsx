        In React.js, a CLI (Command Line Interface) command refers to commands that are run in the terminal or command prompt to perform various tasks related to React application development. The most commonly used CLI tool for React is Create React App (CRA), which provides a set of commands to create, build, and manage React projects.

       Common CLI Commands in React.js
       npx create-react-app:

       Used to create a new React application with all the necessary configuration and boilerplate code.
       npm start:

       Runs the development server and serves the application with hot-reloading enabled.
       npm run build:

       Builds the application for production, optimizing and bundling the code.
       npm test:

       Runs the test suite for the application.
       npm run eject:

       Ejects the configuration files from create-react-app to allow full control over the build configuration (not recommended unless necessary).
       Example of Using CLI Commands
       Step 1: Setting Up a New React Project

       Create a New React App:

       Use npx create-react-app to create a new React projectsh

       npx create-react-app my-app
       cd my-app
       This command generates a new React project in the my-app directory with a default structure and configuration.

       Project Structure:

       The generated project structure looks like this:

       java
       Copy code
       my-app
       ├── node_modules
       ├── public 
       │   ├── index.html
       │   └── .. .
       ├── src
       │   ├── App.css
       │   ├── App.js
       │   ├── index.css
       │   ├── index.js
       │   └── ...
       ├── .gitignore
       ├── package.json
       └── README.md
       Step 2: Running the Development Server
       Start the Development Server:

       Use npm start to run the local development server.
       sh

       npm start
       This command starts the development server and opens the application in the default web browser at http://localhost:3000.

       Step 3: Building the Project for Production
       Build the Application:

       Use npm run build to create a production build of the application.
       sh

       npm run build
       This command bundles and optimizes the application for deployment. The output is placed in the build directory.

       Step 4: Running Tests
       Run the Test Suite:

       Use npm test to run the tests defined in the project.
       sh

       npm test
       This command runs the test runner in an interactive watch mode, providing feedback on test results.

       Step 5: Ejecting the Configuration
       Eject the Configuration (if necessary):

       Use npm run eject to eject the configuration files from create-react-app.
       sh

       npm run eject
       Note: Ejecting is a one-way operation and gives you full control over the configuration files. It is not recommended unless you need to customize the build process extensively.

       Conclusion
       CLI commands in React.js, especially those provided by Create React App, simplify the process of setting up, running, building, and testing React applications. By using these commands, developers can streamline their workflow and focus more on writing code rather than managing configurations and dependencies.
