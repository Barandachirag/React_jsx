        Installing React.js involves setting up Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager), as React and its ecosystem rely on these tools. Here are the steps to install React.js on both Windows and Linux, along with instructions to install NPM and check its version.

        Installing React.js on Windows
        Step 1: Install Node.js and NPM
        Download Node.js:

       Visit the official Node.js website.
       Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version which includes NPM.
       Install Node.js:

       Run the downloaded installer.
       Follow the installation prompts and ensure the option to install NPM is checked.
       Complete the installation.
       Verify Installation:

       Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.

       Run the following commands to check the installation and versions:
       node -v
       npm -v
       Step 2: Create a New React Application
       Open Command Prompt or PowerShell:

       Navigate to the directory where you want to create your React application.
       Use Create React App:

       Run the following command to create a new React application:
       npx create-react-app my-app
       
       cd my-app
       Start the Development Server:

       Run the following command to start the development server:
       npm start

       Installing React.js on Linux
       Step 1: Install Node.js and NPM
       Update Package Index:

       Open your terminal and update the package index:
       sudo apt update
       
       Install Node.js and NPM:

       Install Node.js from the NodeSource repository to get the latest version. First, install the NodeSource PPA:
       curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
       sudo apt install -y nodejs
       
       Verify Installation:

       Run the following commands to check the installation and versions:
       node -v
       npm -v
       These commands should output the versions of Node.js and NPM installed.

       Step 2: Create a New React Application
       Open Terminal:

       Navigate to the directory where you want to create your React application.
       Use Create React App:

       Run the following command to create a new React application:
       npx create-react-app my-app
       cd my-app
       
       Start the Development Server:

       Run the following command to start the development server
       npm start
       
       How to Install NPM (if not included)
       In case NPM is not installed with Node.js, you can install it separately:

       Install NPM:
       Run the following command (this typically comes with Node.js, so this step is usually not needed):
       sudo apt install npm
       
       How to Check the Version of NPM
       To check the version of NPM, you can use the following command:
       npm -v
       
       Summary
       Install Node.js and NPM from the official website or using the package manager on Linux.
       Verify the installation using node -v and npm -v.
       Use npx create-react-app my-app to create a new React application.
       Navigate to your project directory and start the development server with npm start.
       By following these steps, you can set up React.js on both Windows and Linux operating systems
